Robot</h1>
<p><img src="model.png" alt="" class="inline"/>     <br  />
 The diameter of the entire robot is 160mm. This model fits the 3 omni wheels, and their corresponding motors in the bottom section of the 3D print frame. The center mounted motor is offset and controls the inertial disk. The sudden changes in the direction of the inertial disk enables rotational motion of the entire bot. There is also a motor mounted across each omni wheel powering them in direct drive. The main PCB and microcontroller will be mounted at the top of the sphere as it is lightweight and more protected there. The IMU, camera and Bluetooth module all plug in directly into the PCB. The motors are located near the bottom of the robot lowering the center of mass and allowing rotation of the robot to move the ball forward. The battery is tucked underneath the PCB as the space was convenient and allows for minimal wiring. <br  />
</p>
<p><img src="actual.png" alt="" class="inline"/>     <br  />
 Although we had some manufacturing troubles and delays, we ultimatley resolved them and every mechanical system was implemented together as we had designed. We had mimimal tolerancing issues as a majority of components were attached to the acrylic center plane meaning that we had minimal tolerance stack ups. Most of the wiring was taut, and secured with electrical tape to rigid support structures when there was proximity to a rotating part.<br  />
 Although a majorty of mechanical implementation was a success, there was one key short coming that was catastrophic to the project. Although we had placed the heaviest componenets near the center or at the bottom, we did not have a low enough center of mass to move as we had intended. This meant that a majority of movement was intertial rather than center of gravity based. We tried to remedy this by attaching weights to the low hanging motor, however, it was insufficient to make a meaningful difference. We discovered by removing the inertial disk we could heavily alleviate this center of gravity issue, however, with how much tuning remained on the drive portion of the code to reach full functionality, we kept the center wheel as it was intresting to see. <br  />
</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="structuresection2"></a>
Remote</h1>
<p>The second major component of our project was the remote used to move the robot. It can be found in the figure. This was used to control the robot seen in the above figure through a series of 3 drive modes including: Direct Drive, IMU Mode, and Camera Mode. <br  />
 <img src="remote.png" alt="" class="inline"/>     <br  />
</p>
<p>The remote board PCB as detailed later in the report was housed in this wheel shaped 3D print. The user has 6 buttons, a switch to start up the board, and a potentiometer. 4 status LEDs tell the user which drive mode they are in. A Bluetooth module located within the remote sends data based on the inputs to the robot allowing the user to control the bot. <br  />
 <img src="buttons.png" alt="" class="inline"/>     <br  />
</p>
<p>The push buttons that we selected depressed on a different surface than we expected meaning we needed to 3D print button housings to attach the buttons to the internal wheel surface. This introduced additional complications as using the heat gun for heat shrink caused the prints to shrink. This caused the buttons to feel sticky and was partially fixed by remolding the prints once again with the heat gun. <br  />
</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="structuresection3"></a>
Design Flaws</h1>
<p>Our biggest structural design flaw was the center of gravity manipulation after creation. Coming into the build, we knew we would have to add weights to the robot in specific locations to help lower the center of gravity and balance the bot. However, we focused too heavily on other aspects of the project and this bit got swept under the rug until it was too late to change. </p>
